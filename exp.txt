Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm a saint, and I'm a sinner
I'm a loser and a winner
Without faith and a believer
I am true and the deceiver
I'm a hero and a villain
I'm a myth, and I'm a legend
Without strength and a contender
I am real and the pretender
Take me as I am, or don't
'Cause I don't give a damn, no
Take me as I am, or don't
'Cause I don't give a damn, no
I have my flaws
I make mistakes
But I'm myself
I'm not ashamed
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
